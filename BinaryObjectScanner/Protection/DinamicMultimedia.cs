        // LockBlocks falls under this category, being created by and seemingly exclusively in Dinamic Multimedia products, but in every place I find it described online, it is said to very specifically have two rings on the data side of the disc.
        // Due to there being seemingly no absolute defining feature to LockBlocks other than this, any protected disc from Dinamic Multimedia that doesn't specifically have two rings is considered to have "Dinamic Multimedia Protection".
        // That being said, it may be entirely possible that LockBlocks is the name for all these protections as a whole, as some sources seem to consider games that don't seem to have two rings to have LockBlocks.
